## 🔭 Overview

**TubeBrief** is a web app that helps users quickly generate summaries of any public <Note variant="box">YouTube video</Note>. It fetches video transcripts using a Transcript API (via RapidAPI) and then uses **Gemini AI** to generate a concise, readable summary. All summaries are saved into the database, so you can browse previous summaries anytime.

The goal is simple: consume valuable video content in less time, with less cognitive load.
